### ðŸ”¹ Quick Sort Function

```python
def quick_sort(arr):
```

Defines a function called `quick_sort` that takes a list `arr` as an input.

---

```python
    """
    Quick Sort Algorithm that returns a new sorted list.
    Uses recursion and selects the last element as pivot.
    """
```

A **docstring** that briefly explains:

- This is the Quick Sort algorithm.
- It returns a **new sorted list** (it does not modify the original list).
- It uses **recursion** and selects the **last element** as the pivot.

---

```python
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr  # Base case: single-element list is already sorted
```

This is the **base case** for recursion.  
If the array has **0 or 1 elements**, itâ€™s already sorted â€” so return it as-is.

---

```python
    pivot = arr[-1]  # Choosing the last element as pivot
```

The pivot is chosen as the **last element** of the array.  
In Python, `arr[-1]` gives the last item in the list.

---

```python
    left = [x for x in arr[:-1] if x <= pivot]  # Elements â‰¤ pivot
```

This is a **list comprehension**:

- `arr[:-1]` means: all elements except the pivot (last element).
- This builds a new list `left` of all elements **less than or equal to** the pivot.

---

```python
    right = [x for x in arr[:-1] if x > pivot]  # Elements > pivot
```

Another list comprehension:

- Same as above, but now it collects elements **greater than** the pivot.
- This becomes the `right` list.

---

```python
    return quick_sort(left) + [pivot] + quick_sort(right)
```

Now we **recursively call** quick_sort on both the `left` and `right` halves:

- Sort `left`
- Add the `pivot`
- Sort `right`

Then we **combine** them as:

```
(sorted left) + [pivot] + (sorted right)
```

This is the **heart of Quick Sort** â€“ divide, conquer, and combine.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Main Program

```python
print("Enter elements separated by spaces:")
```

Asks the user to input numbers separated by spaces.

---

```python
arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
```

- `input()` reads the input as a string.
- `.split()` breaks the string into a list of words/numbers.
- `map(int, ...)` converts each to an integer.
- `list(...)` collects them into a list called `arr`.

---

```python
print("Original array:", arr)
```

Prints the original, unsorted array for reference.

---

```python
sorted_arr = quick_sort(arr)
```

Calls the `quick_sort()` function and stores the **new sorted list** in `sorted_arr`.

---

```python
print("Sorted array:  ", sorted_arr)
```

Prints the final sorted result.

---

### ðŸ”š Summary:

- âœ… This is a **recursive** Quick Sort.
- âœ… It creates **new lists** instead of sorting in-place.
- âœ… It shows the power of Pythonâ€™s **list comprehensions** and **recursion**.
