Let's break down the code **line by line**, along with the purpose of each operation. This script works with **student classification data** and performs operations like merging, sorting, pivoting, and indexing using the **Pandas library**.

---

### ðŸ“¦ **1. Importing Pandas Library**
```python
import pandas as pd
```
- This imports the `pandas` library with the alias `pd`, which is used for data manipulation and analysis.

---

### ðŸ“¥ **2. Load the Student Classification Dataset**
```python
student_data = pd.read_csv('Practical Codes/IAI/3 - Pandas Library/Data.csv')
```
- Loads the `Data.csv` file into a Pandas DataFrame named `student_data`.
- This CSV includes student details like:
  - `Id`, `Student_Age`, `Sex`, `High_School_Type`, `Scholarship`, `Attendance`, `Grade`, etc.

#### âœ… Example CSV Content
| Id   | Student_Age | Sex  | High_School_Type | ... | Grade |
|------|--------------|------|------------------|-----|--------|
| 5001 | 21           | Male | Other            | ... | AA     |
| 5002 | 20           | Male | Other            | ... | AA     |

---

### ðŸ§ª **3. Create a Sample Exam Scores DataFrame**
```python
exam_scores = pd.DataFrame({
    'Id': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    'Exam_Score': [85, 78, 90, 88, 92]
})
```
- Creates a new DataFrame with student `Id` and their `Exam_Score`.
- This DataFrame simulates another dataset you want to **merge** with the student classification data.

---

### ðŸ”— **4. Merge Both Datasets on `Id`**
```python
merged_data = pd.merge(student_data, exam_scores, on='Id', how='left')
```
- Merges the `student_data` and `exam_scores` using `Id` as the key.
- `how='left'`: All rows from `student_data` are preserved, and exam scores are joined where matching `Id` exists.
- If `Id` doesn't match, `Exam_Score` will be `NaN`.

```python
print("\nMerged Dataset:\n", merged_data.head())
```
- Displays the first 5 rows of the merged dataset.

---

### ðŸ”¢ **5. Sort by Exam Score (Descending)**
```python
sorted_data = merged_data.sort_values(by='Exam_Score', ascending=False)
```
- Sorts `merged_data` so that students with the **highest `Exam_Score`** appear first.

```python
print("\nSorted by Exam Score:\n", sorted_data)
```
- Displays the sorted data.

---

### ðŸ“Š **6. Create a Pivot Table**
```python
pivot_table = merged_data.pivot_table(
    values='Exam_Score', index='High_School_Type', aggfunc='mean'
)
```
- Groups data by `High_School_Type` and computes the **average Exam_Score** for each group.
- This shows how students from different school types performed.

```python
print("\nPivot Table - Average Exam Score by High School Type:\n", pivot_table)
```
- Displays the pivot table result.

---

### ðŸ†” **7. Indexing by Student Id**
```python
indexed_data = merged_data.set_index('Id')
```
- Sets the column `Id` as the **index** of the DataFrame, making it easier to look up student records by `Id`.

```python
print("\nIndexed Dataset:\n", indexed_data.head())
```
- Displays the top 5 rows of the indexed data.

---

### âœ… Summary
| Step | Action | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| 1 | Import Pandas | Use DataFrame features |
| 2 | Load Data | Read student data |
| 3 | Create Scores | Add exam scores |
| 4 | Merge | Combine datasets |
| 5 | Sort | Rank students by scores |
| 6 | Pivot | Analyze scores by school type |
| 7 | Index | Optimize access using `Id` |

- A **visual representation** of the pivot table
- A **plot** (like bar chart) of average scores
- Handling of `NaN` in `Exam_Score` after merge
