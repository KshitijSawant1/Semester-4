Absolutely! Here's a **line-by-line explanation** of the `LocalBeamShort` Java code, which demonstrates **Local Beam Search** for optimizing a quadratic function:

---

## 🔍 **Objective:**

Maximize the function  
**`f(x) = -x² + 10x`**  
This function reaches its maximum at `x = 5`.

---

### ✅ **Class Declaration**

```java
public class LocalBeamShort {
```

- Defines the class `LocalBeamShort`, which contains the Local Beam Search logic.

---

### 📌 `evaluate(int x)`

```java
static int evaluate(int x) {
    return -(x * x) + 10 * x;
}
```

- This is the **objective function**:  
  `f(x) = -x² + 10x`
- It is a **parabola** that opens downward, with a maximum at `x = 5`.

---

### 📌 `getNeighbors(int x)`

```java
static List<Integer> getNeighbors(int x) {
    List<Integer> n = new ArrayList<>();
    if (x > 0) n.add(x - 1);
    if (x < 20) n.add(x + 1);
    return n;
}
```

- For a given state `x`, it returns its **neighboring states**.
- Neighbors are defined as `x - 1` and `x + 1` (simple adjacent integers).
- Ensures that `x` stays in the range `[0, 20]`.

---

### 📌 `beamSearch(int k, int maxIter)`

```java
static void beamSearch(int k, int maxIter) {
```

- Performs the **Local Beam Search**.
- `k` = number of states maintained in each iteration (beam width).
- `maxIter` = maximum number of iterations.

---

### 📌 Random Initialization

```java
Random rand = new Random();
List<Integer> states = new ArrayList<>();
for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) states.add(rand.nextInt(21));
```

- Creates a list of `k` **random starting points** between 0 and 20.

---

### 📌 Main Iterative Search

```java
for (int i = 0; i < maxIter; i++) {
    List<Integer> neighbors = new ArrayList<>();
    for (int s : states) neighbors.addAll(getNeighbors(s));
```

- For each iteration:
  - Gathers **all neighbors** of the current `k` states.
  - Combines all these into a single list.

---

### 📌 Sort and Retain Best `k` States

```java
    neighbors.sort((a, b) -> evaluate(b) - evaluate(a));
    states = neighbors.subList(0, Math.min(k, neighbors.size()));
}
```

- Sorts the neighbors by **descending order of evaluation**.
- Keeps only the **top `k` best neighbors** for the next iteration.

---

### 📌 Print Best Result

```java
int best = states.get(0);
System.out.println("Best x: " + best + ", f(x): " + evaluate(best));
```

- After all iterations, prints the **best state and its function value**.

---

### 🔁 `main()` Function

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    beamSearch(3, 10); // k = 3, max iterations = 10
}
```

- Entry point of the program.
- Calls the `beamSearch()` with:
  - `k = 3`: Three states kept in each step.
  - `10 iterations`: Repeats the beam update 10 times.

---

### ✅ **What is Local Beam Search?**

- A heuristic search method.
- Keeps track of `k` states instead of just one (unlike hill climbing).
- From all neighbors of these states, keeps only the best `k`.
- It helps avoid local maxima to some extent.

---

### 🧠 Example Output (Will vary due to randomness):

```
Best x: 5, f(x): 25
```

This is expected, since `x = 5` is the maximum of the function `f(x)`.
