### ✅ **Function Definition and Inputs**
```python
def banker(allocated, maximum, available):
```
- Defines a function named `banker`.
- It takes three inputs:
  - `allocated`: 2D list where each row is a process, and columns are the number of allocated resources of each type.
  - `maximum`: 2D list showing how many resources each process may **at most** request.
  - `available`: List showing how many resources of each type are **available** in the system.

---

### 🧮 Step 1: Get number of processes and resource types
```python
    num_processes = len(allocated)
    num_resources = len(available)
```
- `num_processes` counts how many processes there are (number of rows).
- `num_resources` is the number of different resource types (length of each row).

---

### 🔍 Step 2: Calculate `need` matrix
```python
    need = []
    for i in range(num_processes):
        need.append([maximum[i][j] - allocated[i][j] for j in range(num_resources)])
```
- `need[i][j]` = How many more instances of resource `j` process `i` still needs.
- `need = maximum - allocated`
- The code builds a list `need` by subtracting for every resource of every process.

📌 Example:
If a process needs 7 units but already has 3, then it **still needs 4**.

---

### 📋 Step 3: Setup `finish` list and `sequence`
```python
    finish = [False] * num_processes
    sequence = []
```
- `finish`: Keeps track of whether a process is done or not.
- Initially all set to `False` → No process is completed yet.
- `sequence`: Will hold the order of execution if the system is in a safe state.

---

### 🔁 Step 4: Try to find a safe sequence
```python
    while True:
        found = False
```
- Loop runs until **no more processes can be safely executed**.
- `found` keeps track of whether we could complete any process in this loop.

---

### 🔎 Step 5: Check which process can safely run
```python
        for i in range(num_processes):
            if not finish[i]:
                if all(need[i][j] <= available[j] for j in range(num_resources)):
```
- For each process not finished:
  - Check if it **can run** with the current available resources.
  - `all(need[i][j] <= available[j])` checks that the system has **enough** resources to satisfy the remaining need.

---

### ✅ Step 6: Simulate execution of that process
```python
                    for j in range(num_resources):
                        available[j] += allocated[i][j]
                    finish[i] = True
                    sequence.append(f"P{i}")
                    found = True
```
- If a process can run:
  - We **release its allocated resources** back into `available` (as if it finished).
  - Mark it as `finished`.
  - Add the process to `sequence` (execution order).
  - Set `found = True` to signal progress this round.

---

### ❌ Step 7: If no progress, break (unsafe)
```python
        if not found:
            break
```
- If in a full pass through the process list, **no process can be executed**, then we break.
- This means some processes are **stuck**, and we might be in an **unsafe state**.

---

### ✅ Step 8: Check final status
```python
    if all(finish):
        print("System is in a Safe State.")
        print("Safe Sequence:", " -> ".join(sequence))
    else:
        print("System is NOT in a Safe State.")
```
- If all processes are marked finished → system is **safe**.
- Otherwise, it's **unsafe**, and deadlock is possible.

---

### 📦 Example Input Explanation
```python
allocated = [[0, 1, 0], 
             [2, 0, 0], 
             [3, 0, 2], 
             [2, 1, 1], 
             [0, 0, 2]]

maximum   = [[7, 5, 3], 
             [3, 2, 2], 
             [9, 0, 2], 
             [2, 2, 2], 
             [4, 3, 3]]

available = [3, 3, 2]
```

- 5 processes (P0–P4), 3 types of resources (A, B, C)
- `allocated`: currently allocated resources.
- `maximum`: maximum demand.
- `available`: what's left to give out right now.

---

### ✅ Final Output
- You’ll see whether the system is in a safe state and the **safe execution order** (if any).
