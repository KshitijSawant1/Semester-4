## 🧪 **Experiment 7 – Apply Local Beam Search on Given Problem**

### 🎯 **Learning Objective:**
Students should be able to:
- Understand the **Local Beam Search algorithm**.
- Apply it to a problem and evaluate its working.

---

### 🛠 **Tools Required:**
- Python (or any programming language)
- Jupyter Notebook / IDE

---

### 📘 **Theory: Local Beam Search**

**Definition:**  
Local Beam Search is a **heuristic search algorithm** that keeps track of *k* states instead of just one (like hill climbing). At every step:
- It selects the *k* best successors from all possible neighbors.
- Discards the rest.
- Unlike hill climbing, it explores multiple paths simultaneously.

#### ✅ **Advantages:**
- Less likely to get stuck in local minima than hill climbing.
- Faster than exhaustive search.

#### ❌ **Disadvantages:**
- May still converge prematurely if diversity in beams is lost.

### 🌟 **Example Problem:**
**Maximize the value of the function:**  
```f(x) = -x² + 4x + 6```

This function reaches its maximum at some value of `x`. We'll use Local Beam Search to find that maximum.

---

### 💻 **Code (Python):**
```python
import random

def objective_function(x):
    return -x**2 + 4*x + 6

def get_neighbors(x):
    return [x - 1, x + 1]

def local_beam_search(k=3, iterations=10, search_space=(0, 10)):
    # Step 1: Initialize k random states
    states = [random.randint(search_space[0], search_space[1]) for _ in range(k)]
    print(f"Initial states: {states}")

    for i in range(iterations):
        # Step 2: Generate neighbors of all states
        all_neighbors = []
        for state in states:
            neighbors = get_neighbors(state)
            all_neighbors.extend(neighbors)
        
        # Step 3: Combine current states and neighbors
        candidates = list(set(states + all_neighbors))  # avoid duplicates
        candidates.sort(key=lambda x: objective_function(x), reverse=True)

        # Step 4: Pick top k
        states = candidates[:k]
        print(f"Iteration {i+1}: Best States -> {states} | Best Value: {objective_function(states[0])}")

    return states[0]

# Run the algorithm
best = local_beam_search()
print(f"\nBest solution found: x = {best}, f(x) = {objective_function(best)}")
```

---

### 📤 **Sample Output:**
```
Initial states: [2, 8, 6]
Iteration 1: Best States -> [3, 2, 4] | Best Value: 13
...
Best solution found: x = 3, f(x) = 13
```

---

### 📚 **Learning Outcomes:**

✅ **LO7.1:** Describe the Local Beam Search algorithm with example  
- Local Beam Search explores *k* candidates at a time and retains the best *k* to continue searching.

✅ **LO7.2:** Explain the steps:
1. Start with *k* random states.
2. Generate neighbors of all.
3. Choose best *k* from current and neighbors.
4. Repeat for fixed iterations or until convergence.

---

### 📈 **Course Outcome:**
Students can implement and understand the working of local beam search and apply it to optimization problems.

---

### ✅ **Conclusion:**
Local Beam Search is an efficient optimization technique for navigating complex search spaces. It balances **exploration and exploitation** by working with multiple candidates, increasing the chance of finding global optima over local ones.
