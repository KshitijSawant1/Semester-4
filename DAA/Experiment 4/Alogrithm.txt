DIJKSTRA(Graph, source):
1. Initialize:
   - dist[source] = 0
   - dist[v] = âˆž for all other vertices
   - prev[v] = None for all vertices
   - Add all vertices to a priority queue (Q)

2. While Q is not empty:
   - u = vertex with minimum dist[u]
   - Remove u from Q
   - For each neighbor v of u:
     - alt = dist[u] + weight(u, v)
     - If alt < dist[v]:
         - dist[v] = alt
         - prev[v] = u
         
3. Return dist[], prev[]
